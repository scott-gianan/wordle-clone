# Wordle-Clone

### This is my first project from Josh Comeau's react course called [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/).

# How to play the game

- ### You have six (6) attempts to guess a five (5) letter word.
- ### Each guess must be a five (5)-letter word.
- ### The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

## Examples:
